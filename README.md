Alpha Blog 

I have built Alpha Blog using Ruby on Rails framework and Sqlite database. 
Alpha Blog is the application where users can create their own articles, but for that users need to sign up and need to create their own profile. I had built the authentication system for users to login or signup. I have built authorisation system, that is added different levels of permissions for different users, such as Admin have all the permissions, such as to delete other user profile and to edit, delete other user articles, whereas other users can only view other users profile and their respective articles, also they can create and update their own profile and articles. Articles can be categorised into different categories. I had Built the front-end and styled it using Bootstrap 4. Had Built the back-end and make it communicate with the front-end using the REST architecture. Used Git, Github extensively while building this project.
